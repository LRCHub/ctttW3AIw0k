Waving in the sun goodbye is the word
Going for a ride we do not deserve
Soon we'll be apart
Under the same sky

When you go I stay could we find a way
To enjoy what is left unsaid
Longing for the day
We will join again

Confident and sane heal me from my frights
Turn into sand stranger to the night
Tomorrow we'll rise
Into the same light
