YAlthough we've never ever ever ever met
I need you I need you
You know I can't be missing you live in regret
I'll see you I'll feel you
It's been so long I know you've wanted
For too long I've been stalling
So just get get ready
For when I find you baby
Walking through the garden hand in hand
The grass is beneath us
Sun is shining on our faces turning red
As it sets we're dreaming
It's been so long I know you've wanted
For too long I've been stalling
So just get get ready
For when I find you baby
You're somewhere out there Under The Same Sky
Although we've never ever ever ever met
I need you I need you
So now I won't be missing you live in regret
I'll see you I'll feel you
You're somewhere out there Under The Same Sky
You're somewhere out there Under The Same Sky
