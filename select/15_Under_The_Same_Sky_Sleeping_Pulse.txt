You had me think
That in a world infested with fools
We were under the same sky.
In a scene directed by you.

And to help serve your self-serving nature.
You alienated the ones who loved us.
To fragment the target away from the threat of a common collective,
A conscience of errors.

You had me think.
That in a world infested with fools
We were under the same sky.
But it was all... so far. from the truth.
