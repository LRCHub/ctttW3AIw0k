Hear the wind, hear the snow
Hear the storm, hear the rain
Open your eyes, make a sacrifice
You will see I can do the same

Look into my eyes
You can see yourself
Open up my heart
It's the same as yours

It's the same as yours
You and I under the same sky

The color of my skin
Doesn't tell you anything about me
Where I come from or where I belong
Open my chest my soul flies
Like eagle in the sky
In the sky
In the sky

It's the same as yours
You and I under the same sky
