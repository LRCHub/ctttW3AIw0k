I feel like I have too much to say
I just can't reiterate enough
How much I'm so glad you're here
And I want you to stay here
All I want
For you
To be free
I know
It's hard
to ease
The pain
I'll be fine
As long as we're
Under the same sky
As long as we're
Under the same sky
As long as we're
Under
The same sky
As long as we're under the same sky
You are so worth being happy
And so worth having a long life
I don't ever want to lose you
And I'm sorry that it feels this way
I wish I could do anything to help
I just feel so terrible
